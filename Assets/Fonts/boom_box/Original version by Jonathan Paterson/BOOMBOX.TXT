                          -----------------------
                  Released as freeware in September 1997.

     A few of the letters of this font are based on the labelling of a
     cassette radio. Boom Box contains two capital alphabets, numbers
     and basic punctuation, but no accented letters.

     Because of the limitations of Fontographer's automatic hinting,
     Boom Box may look badly disproportioned on screen, but it prints
     satisfactorily in display sizes at 300 d.p.i.

     You may use Boom Box without payment, but you may not sell this
     font or distribute a modified version without my written consent.
     Boom Box may not be distributed without the accompanying text
     file.

     To avoid loss of quality, please do not convert this font to other 
     formats without checking with me first. Boom Box is currently 
     available in four formats (PostScript and TrueType for both 
     Macintosh and Windows) and has been tested in all four formats.
